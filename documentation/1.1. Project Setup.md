## 01. Install Angular CLI and Nx

We need to have both the Angular CLI and the nrwl schematics installed globally. Run the following commands.

```Terminal
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

```Terminal
npm install -g @nrwl/schematics
```

## 02. Create a new Nx workspace

Run the below command in a terminal to make a new nx workspace.

```Terminal
npx create-nx-workspace@latest wedofinance
```

You'll be prompted for a preset. Select `"Integrated Monorepo"` then `"Angular"`.

## 03. Position inside the generate workspace

Change directories into the newly created workspace and run the following command.

```Terminal
cd ./wedofinance
```

## 04. Create a shell application

Install the Angular schematic needed to create an Angular app.

```Terminal
npm install @nrwl/angular
```

Create a new app by running the below command in the terminal.

```Terminal
npx nx g @nrwl/angular:host shell --dynamic
```

Choose `"scss"` as your stylesheet language.

## 05. Create other microfrontend applications

Create a new apps by running the below command in the terminal. Choose `"scss"` as your stylesheet language in all applications.

```Terminal
npx nx g @nrwl/angular:remote first-microfront --host=shell
```

```Terminal
npx nx g @nrwl/angular:remote second-microfront --host=shell
```

## 06. Create libraries for shared code between shell and remotes

```Terminal
nx g @nrwl/angular:lib shared/auth
```

```Terminal
nx g @nrwl/angular:lib shared/material
```


>**Don't forget to add new exports in `"index.ts"` for each new class you want to be accessable from outside of library:** 

```TypeScript
export * from './lib/"service-name".service';
```

## 07. Start application

```Terminal
`npx nx serve shell --devRemotes="first-microfront,second-microfront"`
```
